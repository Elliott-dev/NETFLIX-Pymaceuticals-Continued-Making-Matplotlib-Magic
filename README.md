## Instructions:

Regenerate Data and Create Detailed Subplot

1. Used the previous code, re-imported, cleaned and visualized the drug regimen data from the Pymaceuticals Notebook. 

2. Used `plt.subplot()` to create a figure with a 2x2 subplot layout, where the first plot is our original boxplot from the previous Pymaceutical Notebook.

3. For the second plot within the subplot, created a horizontal bar chart showing the largest final tumor volume for each drug regimen.

4. For the third plot within the subplot, created a scatter plot that shows final tumor volume by drug regimen and colored by the mouse `Sex`. 

5. For the fourth plot within the subplot, creatde a scatter plot that shows final tumor volume by drug regimen and colored by mouse `Age_months` using a colorbar.
